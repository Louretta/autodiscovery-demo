Pet Adoption Java Enterprise Application Deployment Automation with Infrastructure Orchestration
Welcome to the pet adoption Java Enterprise Application Deployment Automation project! This project automates the deployment of a Java enterprise application within a containerized, highly available, and scalable environment on AWS, emphasizing efficient infrastructure orchestration.

Key Features:
Continuous Integration (CI): Implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub for automated builds triggered by code commits. Code quality analysis with SonarQube ensures adherence to predefined quality gates before deployment.
Artifact Management: Utilize Nexus repository for storing Maven artifacts and Docker images, simplifying versioning and management of deployable assets.
Containerization: Dockerize the application for consistent deployment across environments and scalability.
Infrastructure Orchestration: Ansible automates deployment and configuration management of AWS services (EC2, RDS, Autoscaling, Load Balancer) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
Monitoring and Alerting: Employ New Relic for monitoring application and infrastructure layers, with alerts configured to notify of errors and resource usage anomalies.
Security: Secure server communication with SSL certificates, and manage sensitive data using RDS for persistent storage and Vault for secure secret management.


Technologies Used:
Java, Maven, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, AWS (EC2, RDS, Autoscaling, Load Balancer), New Relic.
